On a Linux/Mac system, you'll want to run Laundry on an interval.

Run "crontab -e" and use something like this to run the laundry-tick script
every five minutes:

*/5 * * * * /Users/me/laundry/laundry-tick.sh

The youtube-dl script is used for downloading media and is updated regularly.
"sudo crontab -e" and add something like this to check for updates daily.

30 0 * * * node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/laundry/node_modules/youtube-dl/scripts/download.js
